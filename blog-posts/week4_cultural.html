			<h3>Post 4: Inequality & Tech</h3><br>
			<p>
				Among the many challenges facing the burgeoning tech industry, the problem of wealth inequality poses perhaps the greatest threat to the industry's ability to continue to grow and innovate as it has in the past. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The problem of wealth inequality goes beyond its seemingly simple definition as an unequal distribution of assets in the economy. Across America, the slow but steady stagnation of the middle class and rise of an increasingly powerful elite upper class has yielded a declining public education system, an ineffective political system, and a volatile business climate. Technological progress is indeed always tied to the soceopolitical environment in which it operates, and wealth inequality today threatens to stall the innovation engine fueling our current tech boom. 
			</p>
			<p>	
				For example, if schools fail to teach to the skills needed for high tech jobs, the pool of talent from which the next Facebook or Apple is pulled will be less capable to tackle the problems of tomorrow. 
				Furthermore, as governments around the country become increasingly influenced by the very powerful few, economic opportunity and growth becomes less evenly distributed and oligopolies prosper. Technological innovation relies on competitive markets to thrive, yet the consequences of a government for and by the wealthy will inevitably be an innovation slog rather than a sprint.
				Entrepreneurs also depend on low barriers to entry in order to grow new companies/ideas/products. While there is enormous potential with technology today, wealth inequality affects businesses too as smaller firms struggle to compete against their incredibly deep-pocketed multinational competitors.   
			</p>
			<p>
				At the heart of this trend towards inequality, the tech world represents both the problem and the solution. As the latest arena of irresponsible financial speculation and get-rich-quick economics, tech is teeming with over-the-top wealth and widening inequality. The information age is truly transformative, though, and in many ways modern technology has had a democratizing effect in disrupting the old power structures that perpetuate an unequal economic system. Over time, there are very big decisions to be made on how to both slow the widening wealth inequality gap and accelerate the development of progressive technologies.
