			<h3>What Is Recursion?</h3>
				<p>
					At the most basic level, recursion simply describes some expression in which the term(s) generated are produced by a mathematical operation.
					It's something that exists beyond computer programming, but here we're going to focus on its applications in code. In developer speak, recursion is very much like iteration and looping. Recursive methods/functions call reflexively, powered by some sort of base case which keeps the recursive code from running infinitely. Simple mathematical examples help explain how it works:<br><br><br>

			<h3>What's Happening Here...</h3>
				<p>
					This small method takes a number 'n' and runs a simple test by calling itself to produce a countdown sequence. The base case is simply running a test if 'n' = 0, and will countdown until it gets there. At this point your programming brain might be thinking this looks a lot like looping. Indeed it does. It's a good idea to take this opportunity to point out some of the similarities and differences between recursion and iteration in code.
				</p>
			<h3>Similarities</h3>
				<p>
					Both recursive and iterative code appraoches complex tasks in the same manner of breaking it down into smaller pieces and taking those one at a time. Where iteration keeps repeating its code until a certain point is reached, recursive code combines the results as it works. Both work in a looping manner through a problem, and both involve breaking down a complex task into parts that can be easier completed. Also, iterators also usually have parameters with which to test that somewhat resemble the base cases rooting recursive calls. 
				</p><br>
			<h3>Differences</h3>
				<p>
					Whereas recursive calls are designed to bring the input closer to the base case, though, iterator blocks pass constraints that help guide the program's output. Recursion is also more common in mathematical solutions, where it seems to be better suited. Its solutions are shorter than those created using loops, but it also can be more dificult to manage working solutions in a design.
					Iterators are more controlled within the loop, making them more appealing to those running a complex program. Recursion tends to run slower in these programs, but it is nevertheless often more sophisticated in its work. One word that often comes up to describe great recursive solutions is "elegant."
					Granted, they can also be more risky and you have to be careful avoiding infinite calls when the program runs. Furthermore, because recursve code so heavily uses the call stack it can burn through more memory than is necessary for some function in web app.

					Overall, recursion is to be appreciated even if you won't use it as much as iteration in your programs. Recursion gives the foundation for the latter's approach to problem-solving, and can help solve seemingly large problems in with relatively little code.
