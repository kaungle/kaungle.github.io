				In all honesty, the thought of working through the toughest coding challenges with a partner scared me at first. I worried that I would find myself matched with someone far more experienced, and would likely mess things up. I worried about trying not to mess things up, much less being able to contribute to the team. What if I was difficult to pair with? I wondered how my particular learning style would (or not) mesh with others, and was skeptical to say the least.

				After my first pairing session, however, it became apparent how wrong and crazy my preceptions had been. My partner was just as inexperienced as I, and we bonded over both being so overwhelmed with all the material to learn. More than merely solve a coding challenge, we related to each other's struggles with programming and were able to offer support. Because, in the end, that's what this peer pairing program thing is all about. SUPPORT. 
				As a young developer, we are going to need a good amount of it. And who better to know how to give that support than the person going through the same struggles as you? Matter of fact, pairing the coding experience has become my favorite part of DBC so far.

				As for the feedback process, it has been shown time and time again how valuable those responses can be in a learning environment. I find it very helpful to read others' feedback, though I also admit the process is far from perfect and some of the parameters by which we are asked to judge our peers are arbitrary at best. Nevertheless, much of my own personal feedback has been spot-on and very helpful. I try to be as aware as possible of my tendency to move too quickly through a problem in search of the first solution, for example, and the feedback system makes it much easier to track my progress in working through this issue. With that value of the feedback in mind, I try to provide the most accurate and concise responses to my peers. Again, sometimes this can be difficult and seem vague. But overall, I believe feedback is paramount towards improving a learning enviornment and welcome it here at DBC!
