			<h3>Post 8: The Compass of Shame</h3><br>
			<p>
				What was once a defensive mechanism that kept humans connected to each other in groups where they were safer and sronger, shame continues to evolve with us as a formative emotion. And it can be even more influential during times of conflict.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recently, I had an argument with a roommate that became a bigger conflict and left me feeling ashamed. It began as a heated conversation about some controversial current events and quickly grew into a more personal fight. My roommate turned our disagreement into a larger conflict with my personality, which I took in the worst way. I shut down, left the room, and was immediately ashamed about the whole thing. How did a politically charged debate turn into a nasty spat and attacks on personality? Why did that just happen?
				The whole thing went from calm conversation to all out yelling in under five minutes, and nearly came to blows before I left the room. The 'fight' was over in less than 10 minutes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I wondered what could have caused such a nasty exchange, disappointed because I knew whatever the source it was not worth such anger. I realized I handled the whole thing awefully, but was so hurt and angry that I decided to just sleep on it. 
				Without a doubt, leaving the room was the best thing I did during the conflict, as it was escalating way too quickly. Then again, locking myself in my room refusing to speak to my roommate was a poor decision and deferred our resolution. 
				I wish I could go back and just keep my opinions to myself. The huge personal conflict was not worth some political banter, and in the future I will be more cautious about what I say around my roommate. This is not to say the conflict is unresolved, just that I also try to learn from these experiences and make personal adjustments to be better prepared next time. The argument taught me that I need to be more cool-headed during politically and emotionally charged conversation. I learned that my roommate has views that conflict with mine, and that I'd rather celebrate our differences than pick at each other.  
			</p>

				In DBC, I plan on carrying over these lessons learned from previous conflicts. I know that the high-stress environment will surely aggravate tensions, but am confident that all of our cohorts' students will be too focused learning Ruby to get caught up in energy-sucking conflicts like the one I just had with my roommate!
