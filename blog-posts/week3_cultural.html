			<h3>Post 3: Abstract, Random, Growth</h3>
			<p>
				The Gregoric Mind Styles test is a great tool to help us understand how we learn and think. I certainly agree with the results of the test, and look forward to applying my individual style at DBC. As an Abstract Random thinker, I can harness my ability to listen to others and listen well while pairing. I am also a focused thinker, which can be useful when solving challenges with open-ended instructions. 
				Thus far in Phase 0, the lack of a personalized learning environment and interaction with others has slowed the learning process a bit. The curriculum confuses me as much as it teaches me, and I find myself frustrated more than I'd like with relatively simple coding exercises. Going forward, I am trying to pair more with others on challenges since that seems to help my productivity. I also am trying to add more structure to my workflow so as to be more efficient while coding. 
				If almost a third of the general population is just like me, as the internet suggests, then surely there are many abstract random coders out there. And I just can't wait to be one of them!
				Strengthening my growth mindset, I will work to be better with experimenting to find answers and solve problems independently. 
				My perceptual qualities are a mix between concrete and abstract, and I will work to emphasize both at DBC. Ultimately I think I can grow to use each learning style when appropriate. Anyhow, 'tis time to return to the code and get back to learning!
				Until next time, world...
