			<h2>Design/UI Reflections</h2>
				<p id="p1">
					There are many amazing websites out there, from small blogs to sophisticated web apps like Google Maps. Three of my favorites are <a href="www.earmilk.com">Earmilk</a>,<a href="https://soundcloud.com"> Soundcloud</a>, and <a href="hypem.com">Hype Machine</a>. All of them music websites, I really appreciate the innovative ways each brings a better music experience to users.

				<h3><a href="www.earmilk.com">Earmilk</a></h3>
				<a href="www.earmilk.com"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v333/psdean21/EarmilkLogo.jpg" /></a>
				<p>
					Earmilk is a great example of the potential success of small organically grown blogs. When I am on the homepage, the black background and neon text elements immediately grab my attention. Even when stepping away from the screen a bit, the color palette is just as striking. Images and tables are well formatted, inviting the user to scroll down the page.
				</p>
				<ul>Visually, Earmilk is: 
					<li>Smooth</li>
					<li>Dark</li>
					<li>Saturated</li>
					<li>Aesthetic</li>
					<li>Fluid</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Earmilk solves the problem of searching for new music online. Mostly song posts, it also features some video content.
				</p> 
				<ul>The content and focus of Earmilk is:
					<li>Artistic</li>
					<li>Musical</li>
					<li>Articles</li>
					<li>Expository</li>
					<li>Explorational</li>
				</ul>
				<p>	
					Its visual appearance as an aesthetically pleasing, saturated site communicates that Earmilk is a place to discover cool new things (mostly music).

					Search is made easy on the homepage with a color coded groovy looking navbar that breaks down content by genre. There is also a search bar at the bottom of every page. The homepage begins a 'latest posts' section to browse through, as well. Content is easy to navigate, overall, with these multiple access points. 
					
					When the music player has good sounds, I sometimes find myslef on Earmilk for hours on end. It becomes like a radio station. If the music is not my style, however, I become bored with the site after about 15 minutes browsing. They might do better directing users to more pre-curated playlists to listen to while exploring the sites textual and video content. Earmilk is still a straightforward music blog, and does not yet offer any merchandise or paid services to purchase
				</p><br>
				<h3><a href="https://soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a></h3>
				<a href="https:soundcloud.com"><img src="https://coderwall-assets-0.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/picture/file/641/soundcloud_logo_css_by_timpietrusky.png" /></a>
				<p>
					Sometimes called the YouTube of internet music, SoundCloud has become a giant website over the past few years. I keep coming back for its great community of music lovers. The site is built around user sharing, going beyong the simple social media widgets featured on other blogs and creating a complete music social network with which to interact with the online music community. In short, SoundCloud is awesome!
				
					On the signed in homepage, users are immediately incentivized to press play and start streaming. The graphic design of the music player next to each song makes it feel as if you stumbled into a legit studio. There is also the requisite super resourceful navbar and sidebar. From further distance, again, the graphic design of the SoundCloud player jumps off the page and invites the user to engage with the site while listening. 
				</p>
				<ul>Visually, SoundCloud is:
					<li>Straightforward</li>
					<li>Organized</li>
					<li>Thematic</li>
					<li>Social</li>
					<li>Interactive</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					SoundCloud goes beyond merely competing with music blogs for first-post-props with its social network, giving musicians and fans a more interactive hub online to share and discover content. It also attempts to use its seamless sharing platform to transform how music is made and listened to.
				</p>
				<ul>SoundCloud is focused on Music:
					<li>Sharing</li>
					<li>Discovery</li>
					<li>Community</li>
					<li>Creation</li>
					<li>Collaboration</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Prioritizing the social element in music, SoundCloud facilitates organized and interactive sharing for both musicians and fans with its social network layout. From there, discovery, creation, and collaboration become easier and more engaging.
					From any page on SoundCloud, the search bar is the primary tool to look for content. The feed of songs on the homepage is also divided, with an extra 'Explore' tab, for better browsing. 
					Content is navigable as well as fun to interact with. Everything is easy to find, clear, and clean. 
					This simple layout is effective in allowing users to spend extended periods of time listening, browsing, and/or sharing music. 

					Importantly, SoundCloud links to iTunes & Amazon's Music Store directly from the audio player to allow listeners to purchase songs after listening. Still, though, much of the music on the site is free to listen and download.
				</p>
				<h3><a href="hypem.com">Hype Machine</a></h3>
				<a href="hypem.com"><img src="http://musformation.com/pics/hype-machine-logo.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Hype Machine is a music listening and sharing platform that lands somehwere in between the functionality of SoundCloud and the bloggy character of Earmilk.Allowing users to follow activity within the music community in real time, this site offers an innovative approach to discovering new sounds. I like to think of it as the internet's Billboard charts. 

					On the homepage, users are unfortunately inundated with full-page advertising. More so than on SoundCloud or Earmilk, here it draws you away from content. From further back, the ads still dominate the aesthetic appearance of the page. Thankfully this is just on the homepage when users first visit. Once the ads recede, Hype Machine visually appears:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Direct</li>
					<li>Minimalist</li>
					<li>Templated</li>
					<li>Ergonomical</li>
					<li>Clean</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					This website aggregates activity from the top music blogs across the web, creating charts of new and popular music with a truly eclectic mix of sounds. Its algorithm allows users to hear new music that would likely go otherwise unnoticed on a music blog, where name familiarity is more essential to navigating content. Hype Machine sets out to organize content with different playlists and the ability to create a dynamic user profile, more akin to SoundCloud than Earlmilk. Here, howerver, users can follow specific blogs as well as artists. 

					With a very well-integrated music player and great playlists, Hype Machine is a website on which you can spend hours. With even more playlist options released recently, its too easy to keep the good music playing. 

					Hype Machine sells merchandise to promote its brand. I recently bought one of their t-shirts--their logo is pretty sweet.
