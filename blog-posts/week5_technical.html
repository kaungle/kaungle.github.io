			<h3>Why Use Classes?</h3>
				<p>
					Becasue Ruby is so awesome, it is always looking for ways to help make your code more functional. For example, you may sometimes find that certain methods and variables are being restricted in scope and thus making it harder to run a program. 
					Ruby brings the Class object along to help sort out objects so they can reach as far as they like throughout your code. Just imagine all those little Ruby objects reaching their full potential -- built-in and class-wide variables, oh my!. Let's look at an example of a Class in action to see how it all works with this example from <a href="rubylearning.com/satishtalim/writing_our_own_class_in_ruby.html">RubyLearning.com</a>(feel free to copy/paste this code into your own IRB!):

			<h3>You have such Class!</h3>
				<p>
					We now have a working 'Dog' Class with its own instance variables and methods, which we can call and manipulate after setting them in the Class. The syntax for declaring a new Class and then calling that Class is very straightforward, as you see in lines 28 & 49. The variable 'd' is a simple reference variable for Dog, and dot notation is used most often when declaring new Class objects/variables. Classes also have their very own methods, and we use one of the most popular ones here by calling 'new' on 'Dog' to establish a new object. Object oriented programming is based around manipulating and responding to real world objects, and classes help achieve this functionality by providing another layered data structure with which to store information. Check them out at cool places like <a href="https://rubymonk.com">RubyMonk</a>, and take your new classy talents to the world!
