			<h3>Just Say No...To SQL</h3>
				<p>
					SQL is the classic query language, using relational
					databases to organize data. Originally designed decades ago, SQL can only go so far in handling the increasing volume and complexity of data queries in today's web landscape. It also has a more rigid syntactical structure, which can make it buggy and problematic. To be sure, though, SQL still has redeeming qualities. With data stored in a single structure, for example, SQL provides consistency in operations. It's durable, and with individual databases SQL isolates information which can protect data from being corrupted. And that strict syntax I mentioned makes reading SQL and following schema pretty straightforward. SQL is not so bad, after all...BUT, why stop at ONLY relational databses?

			<h3>Not Only SQL, It's So Much More!</h3>
				<p>
					NOSQL is really just SQL 2.0. It's more of a SQL sequel (wink, wink) than a completely new replacement. As one of the older programming languages, SQL was in need of a comprehensive update when the Web 2.0 movement began taking off. An important tool for storing and analyzing data, SQL needed to adapt with the times. Over the past 15 years, non-relational distributed data stores have become more common as data has proliferated in new applications with more sophisticated functionality. One of the chief benefits in using Not Only SQL is the ability to scale databases more efficiently. Compared to relational databases, NoSQL data is more flexible and easier to iterate through. The architecture in NoSQL is less monolithic, with semi-structured and unstructured data complementing the tabular structure inherited from SQL. The flexibility of NoSQL is also better suited to object-oriented programming, in which there is typically a larger and more dynamic set of data to be managed. As big data and real-time web apps have proliferated, so to has the use of these more flexible NoSQL databases.

					It's important to understand that whereas SQL is a query programming language, NoSQL refers to a whole range of non-relational data management systems. Many of these systems take cues from the structure and organization set forth by SQL. Where there are limitations in the old style query languages, NoSQL introduces more simple and scalable data structures to power today's data intensive web. This is partially due to the complex nature of objects in modern programs. With XML and other hiearchical objects, using SQL can be a bit tricky. Add to that the sheer volume of queries coming from hundreds of millions of users and relational databases can become slow and buggy. Of course, though, clever code can always get around such problems. Many programmers still use SQL just fine for more simple applications, and even those using NoSQL are typically adding to the foundation laid by old school SQL. So, just how important is it to choose one over the other?

					Ultimately, the 'SQL vs. NoSQL' debate is less of a search for which is better and more a question of understanding the uses of each. Many have their preference, but all developers will likely use elements of both at some point. The most important consideration is how to organize, iterate through, and analyze data in the most efficient manner possible (and with the least amount of code!). Personally, as a strong believer in big data I am more excited to work with the non-relational databases provided in a NoSQL framework. It's true that some SQL products, such as Oracle's, are just as capable at handling large data sets using the tabular structure. But, I believe that as computing evolves into new devices and applications there will be many opportunities to rethink data management systems. And it seems that the NoSQL paradigm is more flexible towards this sort of future. Nevertheless, SQL most likely will continue to serve as the foundation for data mangement systems. From my research, it seems best to start with SQL and then apply NoSQL where relational databases are less efficient. Coding with NoSQL products such as MongoDB appears to be many developers' preference, and I look forward to giving them a try. 
					NoSQL is really more of an offspring of SQL than a diametrically opposed replacement, then. Like a wise elder, SQL offers an original model with which to approach data management. NoSQL is the future, but it was brought into this world via relational databases.
