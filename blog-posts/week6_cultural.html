			<h3>Post 6: Stereotyping the Tech World</h3><br>
			<p>
				Ripe with issues surrounding gender, racial, and wealth ineqaulity, the tech world knows a thing or two about the Stereotype Threat. Let's be honest -- privileged, white males inordinately dominate the scene of celebtrated and accomplished techies (sadly, this is the same case in many other arenas of power and influence in today's world as well). Women and minorities are under-represented at many of the titan companies of the tech industry, while the vast riches being wrought in the current tech gold rush has produced a sometimes ruthless environment in which only the wealthy can compete. The setting is one in which so many identities are excluded and oppressed in the tech world, that now I find many of my peers want nothing to do with the industry.

				I have both seen the Stereotype Threat at work in this industry and experienced some unexpected consequences of its power myself. All of my friends working as software developers are male, and while I do have female friends working in tech as well -- mostly in marketing, sales, and/or business development roles -- they seem to have a differentiated sense of purpose and value in a tech company compared to their much higher-paid engineering peers. The lack of diversity is really staggering, and it inevitably makes whole groups of people feel that they don't fit the mold of a software developer. Or worse, that they are not good enough to be a software developer. Many of my college friends who come from working class families did not have the same exposure to computer science in high school as the more privileged. They are largely excluded from the tech world before they even know if they like it, because of their socioeconomic background. Stereotypes thus abound about tech and the developers behind it, as the overwhelming homogeneity of the industry adversely affects how those who do not fit that privileged-white-male mold are able to workd and add value in the tech industry. In short, it makes feeling a sense of belonging unbelievably difficult.

				Personally, as a privileged white male, I have experienced a slightly different effect of the Stereotype Threat. 
				When I tell people that I am becoming a software developer, despite having gone to school studying law, people have absolutely no problem assigning such a pursuit to my identity as a white male (from Northern California, no less). It's almost as if my sense of belonging in this world should automatically be so solidified, even though I have literally just started coding. This sort of reverse stereotyping is also a problem, as it invites me to feel a false sense of sure-footedness in a world in which I am largely still foreign. And even worse, this stereotype then reinforces the exclusionary stereotype about the tech world! It's amazing how far stereotyping reaches into our sense of self, ultimately shaping how we interact with the world around us. 
			</p><br>

				My response to this Stereotype Threat when I see it in action is usually to call it out on the spot, trying to reduce the Threat's influence to a non-issue. Saying that this works well would be a lie, though. The truth is it takes constant vigilance and the creation of new habits/attitudes over time to change the social landscape and render Stereotype Threat powerless. We must take concrete action to increase access to computer science and diversity in the workplace, while also demanding our education system provides truly equal opportunities for all hard-working students. I believe having an open dialogue about Stereotype Threats is instrumental, too. Ultimately, the innovation at the heart of the tech industry will suffer until all of us confront the negative power of stereotyping and its rampant influence in the tech industry.
