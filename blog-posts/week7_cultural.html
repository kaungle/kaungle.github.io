			<h3>Post 7: Adventure Time</h3><br>
			<p>
				Life is an adventure, to put it simply. I find adventure all around me. It is really more of a way of engaging with the world than a value. Excitement is around every corner, and in general I feel the happiest and most satisfied when on an adventure. Part of this is because an adventure is ever changing and requiring utmost focus on the present. It offers an opportunity to think beyond the sometimes stifling monotony of the usual. Granted, some adventures are better than others. But overall some of the best moments in my life have been part of and/or accompanied by adventure.

				I think the question with adventure is how willing to be to go beyond the ordinary in everyday life. Viewing even relatively small tasks like grocery shopping as adventures in their own right helps keep my life exciting. The root of adventure is the unusual, which inherently necessitates a certain openness towards the unknown other. 
				Stereotypes also thrive off of perceptions of difference. People judge those whom they fear and develop stereotypes as a consequence, and while I am sure I take part in this unfortunate practice to some extent I also focus on staying open towards others. Maintaining more of a positive perspective on the world and treating life as an adventure absolutely helps mediate instances of stereotype threat.

				Feeling down in life is inevitable, even during the best of adventures. While sometimes the circumstances surrounding that feeling are beyond our control, resilience is the fuel that pushes us forward through difficult challenges. DBC is my newest adventure, and although I am sure it will have its ups and downs I am also super excited for what is next to come!
