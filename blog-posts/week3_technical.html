			<h3>Why Jive with JS?</h3>
				<p>
					Created in only ten days, the divine language of JavaScript is now the most widely used programming language on the web. It brings an amazing variety of functionality to websites, while also creating beautiful visual effects. JS works well with data and processing, too. It is great for front end and backend dev work, helping to relieve strain on web servers. JavaScript syntax is similar to English, making it easier to learn. Last but most certainly not least, JS also has third party add-ons that allow developers further customization. So much to love, it's easy to see why some say JavaScript is the language of the future!

			<h3>What's not to love?</h3>
				<p>
					Not a whole lot can be said negatively about JavaScript, since it's already so well established and functional. As with other languages, however, it can still be manipulated to exploit secure information. Snippets in JS are sometimes sent to corrupt and contaminate users' systems. Also, although it is most recognized by browsers, JS can still sometimes render differently depending on the layout engine. This is becoming less of a concern over time, as most new browser versions are becoming geared towards a universal standard. Some JS skeptics say it will be overtaken by new more sophisticated languages in the future -- I am far from qualified to comment on this question -- but for now JavaScript is prevalent as ever!
