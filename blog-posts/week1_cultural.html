				Pioneering a new model for education, DBC takes on the task of learning to code head on. As an outsider who found it difficult to get that initial jumpstart with programming on my own, this type of Bootcamp presents the perfect opportunity to accelerate into the industry. Shereef has produced a truly remarkable culture at DBC, one which goes beyond merely teaching how to make an App. The program transforms students' thinking, while also expanding our abilities. Pushing us harder than we think we are capable of going, DBC also manages to promote well-being through yoga classes and a nap room. Pair programming is also ideal for learning how to code. Dialogical feedback is very helpful while in Sublime, and talking through code helps troubleshoot bugs. I understand the environment is stressful and the curriculum rigorous, and I think it helps students accomplish so much in such a short time. I am, of course, still a bit apprehensive about my own abilities going in to week 2. So long for now!
