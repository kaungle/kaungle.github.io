## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

Git & Github setup were relatively straightforward, although the conversation about repositories and merging, pushing, pulling etc. is still very new to my ears. I struggled a bit understanding all the functionality on GitHub. I learned how to begin interacting with repos, though, and appreciating their importance.

Whereas Git merely refers to the general version control software that manages files for projects as they change, GitHub is the specific tool on which those files are stored and updated. GitHub hosts repos, Git is the distributed version control system at work. 
Version control allows developers to track and make changes to files as they work on projects. Git is a form of version control, while GitHub helps facilitate version control by storing and updating repos. 
Developers use git to better monitor projects and update files, as well as to facilitate efficient collaboration on projects. It is very useful and seems almost necessary now. Git is still very new and unfamiliar, but GitHub seems pretty straightforward to use. I imagine as I put it to use, git will become easier to understand/operate.
