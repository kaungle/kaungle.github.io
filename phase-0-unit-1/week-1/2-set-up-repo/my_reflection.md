## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a repository on Github, simply click the '+' icon near the top right corner of the page (it is right next to your username tab). Select 'New Repository.' On the New Repository Form, simply name, describe, and detail the file before creating the repository. Once created on GitHub, the repository is easily downloaded to your local computer. Using the url tool located on the right hand side of the page saying 'clone URL,' copy the link to your repository and input on your command line for the system to 'git clone' that URL. ALlow your terminal to finish executing the 'git clone' command, then execute the 'ls' command to see the folder with your cloned repository on your local system! 

Open source refers to sharing software code with the public to allow for others to modify/change its functionality. Stepping away from traditional notions of property in the name of better software, the open source movement is undoubdtedly revolutionary. I feel it has great potential, but also requires great safeguards to ensure open source code is used fairly and to continue incentivizing innovations from developers. Not quite Utopia, yet!

Licenses allow developers to collaborate with others and modify their work when facing challenges. Licenses essentially provide the legal framework for others to help with your project. Different licenses have different parameters for protection, designed to serve for a variety of collaborative approaches. 

This challenge cemented the process of making new repositories. My 'aha' moment came from learning this most fundamental process on GitHub, and with that I feel much more capable of using the service. I had a bit of an issue locating the local file I cloned the git to, as every effort I made to navigate into the folder with a 'cd' was met with a 'no such file or directory' message in the terminal. 

I found the git/GitHub resources provided were plenty helpful in explaining the process of creating a repository, but I was unable to troubleshoot the simple problem I had with navigating into the folder to which my computer had cloned the git.
