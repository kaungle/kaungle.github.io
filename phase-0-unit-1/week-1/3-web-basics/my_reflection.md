## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

This lesson taught me that web apps are much more dynamic than static web pages, are updated much more often and typically handle much more data. I also learned that DNS is pretty much a web translator, taking URL addresses and connecting to the appropriate IP addresses. 
When setting up the HTML site, it is important to make sure that the file is saved where it can be easily pushed to github. I think the location of where the HTML file is saved, and the organization of saving such files, is most important to keep in mind. 
Seeing my web page live is cool, although it took more troubleshooting than I anticipated to get online. Even though the index.html file successfully pushed to github, I still receive a 404 error message when going to the URL https://kaungle.github.io
My aha moment was when actually using gitHub, seeing how all the commands work together to move files. 
I found a site called 'GitReal' that has useful tutorials and some pretty sweet design elements on its page.
