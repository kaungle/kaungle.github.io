			<p>Earmilk makes discovering new music online easier, a small blog that has grown into one of the best music sites out there. The challenge music blogs like Earmilk face is balancing a rich content design with the risk of inundating users with too much on the page. It also has to solve the problem of creating a site-wide audio player that continues playback while navigating through different pages, while also staying tucked away neatly from the main content on each page. Spatially, this site attempts to mitigate some of the clutter made by many subheaders with a more minimalist content area, and footer design. There is also the visual challenge of providing the right images for each song post, so users are more engaged with the list of music.

				SoundCloud gives music makers and listeners an online platform through which to grow communities, share, and discover sounds. It is more of a social network than blog, the visual challenge being its ability to blend social widgets and features with its content while still maintaining fluidity. The site keeps things simple in the navbar by emphasizing its search function, while also keeping the main content area a simple list with the song posts appearing as individual rows. The sidebar area on the right is the social hub, and as with Facebook's right sidebar, can be overbearing as users attempt to scroll through the main feed.

				Hype Machine hopes to compete for the users of both Earmilk and SoundCloud, as a music blog aggregator with a bit of a social network of its own. Designed less around the direct release of content by musicians, this site instead sources its content from other blogs. It must address the same visual challenges as the previous two sites, striking the aesthetic appeal on par with Earmilk while also offering dynamic content on par with SoundCloud. The site thus has more color and style than SoundCloud, but is more simple with its song posts. For example, users cannot splice sounds and comment at specific intervals as they can on SoundCloud. Again, the main content area must be fluid and smooth to allow for easy scrolling and searching.
